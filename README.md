## Description

Pet-to-Vet is an application that can be used by pet owners to supply veterinarians with information about their animals. The web application features a patients page with forms to enter information about their pet. We built this application because it provides a useful tool to those who care about their pets and those that provide care.

It address the need for pet owners to be able to find a care provider for their pet and for veterinarians to learn information about their patients.

We learned a great deal about the need for communication. A project becomes much more manageable when everyone has a specific task to focus on.

## Installation

Required packages can be acquired by running an npm install.
Also make sure to run npm -i nodemailer to enable the user to be contacted by email after signing up.

## Usage

The application is web based and requires the user to be logged in with credentials to see of of the site pages or use its features. Upon the creation of an account or logging in the user is presented with the homepage.

This is where they have the option to register their pet. They are given the choice between a dog and a cat. Upon one of these selections they are presented with a form to enter information about the animal such as their name, age and weight. As well as size for dogs and if the animal is declawed for cats.

The site also features pages detailing the services that the practice provides as well as information about how to find the location.
